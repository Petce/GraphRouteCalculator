# Latency Calculator
> PHP CLI Command to calculate routes on a Graph where Latency is a factor.
> Using Dijkstra's shortest path-algorithm.

## Usage
__1. Start the program with (must be a valid CSV in the proper format)__

        $ php index.php <path/to/edges.csv>

Example

        $ php index.php text.csv

__2. Search for routes using the following format (From and To are case sensative and Latency must be an integer)__

        INPUT: <from> <to> <max_latency>

Example

        INPUT: A F 1200

__3. Quit the program with 'QUIT'__

        INPUT: QUIT

## Attribution

In order to speed up the development process for this experiment I have imported an implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path-algorithm.
